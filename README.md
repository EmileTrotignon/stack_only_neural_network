# stack_only_neural_network

A templated neural network. Almost all of the memory is allocated in the stack
This also means that if you want to change the number of layers or their size, you need to recompile.


This is a project with two main goals :
- Get an understanding of how a neural network works.
- Learn advanced C++ concepts (template metaprogramming and move semantics).
